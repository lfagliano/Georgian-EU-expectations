# Georgian-EU-expectations
Repository regarding the CRRC blog on EU expectations

The blog can be read at: https://oc-media.org/features/datablog-georgians-increasingly-optimistic-about-joining-the-eu/

In the blog, and in these scripts, I attempted to analyse the newly published Knowledge and Attitudes of the EU survey. Given the short scope required for blogs, I only focused on data and to get a clear statistical analysis of EU expectations. However, there is a lot to take out from here, for instance:

1) Language as a gateway to access political discourse, and thus the notion of Georgia being able to easily enter the EU. 
2) Ignorance of EU processes, regardless of level of education, as regressions also showed that high level of educations did not predict lower levels of false expectations. 
3) There are even more questions to be asked regarding the impact of news and disinformation in the expectation towards the EU. 
4) Finally, for the future, it will be useful to look at the impact of false expectations, when Georgia fails to join the EU in less than 5 years. In the time series data we can see that there is a sudden crash in EU expectations and EU support following the Ukraine war... will we see the same crash in 5 years when Georgia applies to the EU? If so, will this turn into an internal crisis?
